# ABC File Parser and Analysis
  
**Weight:** 30%
**Submission:** GitHub repository URL + In-class demo

---

You will build an application in Python that:

1. Reads ABC files from multiple folders (representing different books)
2. Parses and stores tunes into a list of dictionaries
3. Stores the data in a mysql database
3. Loads data into pandas for analysis
4. Create a simple user interface so that a user can query the data
5. Maintains proper version control with Git/GitHub

## Dataset Structure
```
abc_books/
├── 0/
│   ├── tune001.abc
│   ├── tune002.abc
│   └── tune003.abc
├── 1/
│   ├── tune100.abc
│   ├── tune101.abc
│   └── tune102.abc
├── 2/
│   ├── tune200.abc
│   └── tune201.abc
└── 3/
    └── tune300.abc
```

- Each numbered folder represents a "book" (collection)
- Each folder contains one or more ABC files
- Each ABC file may contain one or more tunes
- Folder numbers start at 0

---

## Part 1: File Loading & Parsing (30%)

- Recursively traverse the `abc_books/` directory
- Identify all `.abc` files
- Determine the book number from the parent folder name

### Parse and Insert Tunes

For each ABC file:
1. Parse and load all tunes in the file (using logic from previous lab) into an array of dictionaries
2. Insert each tune into the database with the correct book number

---

## Part 2: Data Loading with Pandas (20%)

### Load Data from MySQL

Create a function that loads the entire tunes table into a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector

def load_tunes_from_database():
    """Load all tunes from MySQL into DataFrame"""
    conn = connect_to_database()
    
    query = "SELECT * FROM tunes"
    df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
    
    conn.close()
    return df
```

### Create Analysis Functions

Write functions to analyze the data. Some ideas to get you started, but include other relevant ones:

```python
def get_tunes_by_book(df, book_number):
    """Get all tunes from a specific book"""
    pass

def get_tunes_by_type(df, tune_type):
    """Get all tunes of a specific type"""
    pass

def search_tunes(df, search_term):
    """Search tunes by title (case insensitive)"""
    pass

```

## Part 3: Interactive Elements (30%)

Create a way for a user to interact with the data and run queries. This can be purely menu base like this:



Or you can use py5, tkinter or django

## Part 4: Documentation & Github

Fork [this repo]

Your README must be in [this format](https://github.com/skooter500/csresources/blob/main/assignmentreadme.md):

- Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Add comments for complex logic


## Grading Rubric

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Loading & parsing | 30% |
| Data Analysys | 20% |
| Interactive Elements | 30% |
| Github, documentation & presentation | 20% |

Overall Grade Descriptors

- 1 Exceeds requirements with exceptional implementation, self-directed learning evident, polished and professional
- 2.1 Meets all requirements with high quality implementation and good attention to detail
- 2.2 Meets all core requirements with competent implementation
- Pass - Meets some of the requirements
- Fail - Fails to meet minimum requirements or non-functional
